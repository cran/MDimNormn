Description: Normalize data to minimize the difference between sample plates 
    (batch effects). For given data in a matrix and grouping variable (or
	plate), the function 'normn_MA' normalizes the data on MA coordinates. 
	More details are in the citation. The primary method is 'Multi-MA'. Other 
	fitting functions on MA coordinates can also be employed e.g. loess.
